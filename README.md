# Machine-Learning-Jobs-Postings
Power-Bi visual for Job Postings for Machine Learning Jobs in March and April 2025.
Data was retrieved from Kaggle Featured Datasets, using "Machine Learning Job Postings in the US" csv file uploaded by Ivan Kumeyko.
I cleaned the data in Excel since there were a small number of lines. This included deleting information that was not US related, and blank States that could not be identified. In the case of multiple positions in multiple states I used the first state listed as the state in question.
Findings:
There was a huge uptick in Machine Learning Job postings beginning around March 18, 2025, and the ML job's increased at least until April 9th when the data ended. 
The west region has seen the largest growth in ML job postings with California posting 442 in that time period. The leading Job Title is "Machine Learning Engineer" with 135 positions posted. "Data Scientist" was a distant second with 42 job postings during the same period.
Mid-Senior Level and Entry Level positions are the most frequent skill level posted.
